Personal Projects, to get better at building stuff.

BRIEF DESCRIPTIONS:

1. AUTOMATION PROJECT - Scripting, running commands and interracting with the os directly

2. SLOT MACHINE - Logic execution, text based

3. SNAKE GAME - Logic execution, and consideration of (somewhat) edge cases. Very nostalgic.

4. FAST API - Learning how to create APIs using FAST API. Requires the uvicorn package. (pip install uvicorn)
